# Overview

Carpark is a highly concurrent parking application written in Java's [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) powered by Java 20 and [Spring-Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot). It is scalable to many threads and adapts to the number of cores on the host machine. This implementation is fully unit and integration tested.

## Application Design

### Rationale

To model the carpark, I chose reactor's persistent store [Sinks.Many](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Sinks.Many.html) backed by a bounded blocking double-ended queue (effectively non-blocking). I considered using the highly optimised cache provider [Caffeine](https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine) as an alternative, which is concurrent, highly scalable, and provides near-optimal efficiency within the JVM. However, wanting to stay within the reactive ecosystem, I found Sinks.Many to be a perfect solution for modeling the carpark.

To model car arrivals and departures, I chose [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/). I considered simpler alternatives such as imperative Java and Java8 streams, however reactor is best-in-class for highly concurrent publisher/consumer scenarios. For this project, car arrivals are modeled by publishing events, and car departures by consuming events. 

Furthermore, Reactor: 

- Allows for fast and scalable concurrency with minimal configuration. 
- Provides native [backpressure](https://www.baeldung.com/reactor-core#backpressure). 
- Is easily testable via `reactor-testing library` (testing imperative multi-threaded programs is otherwise very difficult).
- Can be monitored for performance bottlenecks via [Reactor Metrics](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#metrics).

To model the bill register (where copies of `Bills` are stored once issues to `Cars`), I chose the fast and thread-safe `java.util.Set` implementation `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`'s key-set.

### Architecture

## Run Instructions

*Note*: this project requires a Java20 JDK (such as [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/20/)).

You can run the application via an IDE. The IDE used for development and testing is [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) version `2023.1.1 (Community Edition)`.
> Main class: [CarparkApplication](src/main/java/com/acerasoni/carpark/CarparkApplication.java)

Alternatively, you can run the application directly through a CLI using Spring-Boot's [Maven Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins.html#build-tool-plugins.maven).
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

> When you run the application, all cars will be admitted until capacity is reached. Then, cars will begin to be rejected. When spaces free up from cars departing, some new cars will be accepted into the carpark. 

Run with `logging.level.root=DEBUG` for enhanced logs.

## Problem Statement

- When a car comes in, check if there is a space available, otherwise return a message saying that the car park is full.
- There are 100 spaces available in the car park.
- Multiple cars may come in at the same time.
- The solution must be similar to production code.

## Assumptions

For the purpose of this simulation, I have made the following assumptions, which may be modified through the [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties).

- New cars arrive at the car park every 120 milliseconds
- Parked cars depart after 500 milliseconds
- The simulation lasts for 60 seconds
- The simulation is sped up by a factor of 7,200 (such that, in billing terms, 500 milliseconds equal 1 hour)
    > To run the simulation at normal speed, set `carpark.speed-up-factor=7200`
- The currency is in GBP

## Extensions

This application is built to be as similar as possible to a production-ready MVP. However, given the time constraint, lots of useful features were excluded that could implemented on top of the existing project. These include:

- Containerising the application for easy deployment
- Use user input to simulate car arrivals for a more realistic feel
  > Alternatively, configure cars to arrive at a random frequency rather than a fixed one
- Configure cars to depart at a random frequency rather than a fixed one
- Tracing via logs
- Emit logs to an aggregator for efficient searching (i.e. [ELK Stack](https://auth0.com/blog/spring-boot-logs-aggregation-and-monitoring-using-elk-stack/)) 
- Monitor performance and bottlenecks via [reactor-core-micrometer](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#metrics)
- 360Â° observability (including alerting) via Prometheus, Micrometer and Grafana
- Add JavaDocs
